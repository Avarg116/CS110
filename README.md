- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js. Check your npm version with `npm -v`.
- **MongoDB**: You can launch a free MongoDB instance by creating an account. Installation instructions can be found at [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com).

Ensure you have **express-handlebars** and **moment** packages installed. If not, you can install them using npm:

```
Run `npm run start` to execute the application. 
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to see the chatroom application running.
